Discussion of the topic is typically considered successful if each meeting goal is acomplished during the meeting. These goals can be used to guide discussion and ensure it stays on topic. -->
Collect admin opinions on the following questions to act as guidelines until the completion of the policy rewrite, and that can be considered while rewriting policies and guidelines:
1. How should a player disclosing an alternate account used in ban evasion, or the ban evasion attempt itself, affect the player's appeal? Should failure to disclose have any effect?
2. How should multikey be handled when it is disclosed through an appeal? Does it matter if the ban is temporary or indefinite?

### Review minutes

#### Summary

> The meeting minutes provide a record of the meeting for those who could not attend, and they are used to action decisions made in the meeting. For these reasons, it is important that they accurately represent what actually happened in the meeting.
> -Chief_Engineer

#### Meeting Goals

1. Ensure that nothing important is missing or misrepresented in the minutes.
2. Attempt to ensure that all topics have met their meeting goals. This can be done by ensuring that each meeting goal is directly addressed by the conclusion of the topic's minutes.
3. Attempt to ensure that all conclusions fit into one of the following categories:
    1. Indicate that a meeting goal was completed.
    2. Are something actionable, meaning that they not only call for an action, but that action is specific enough that it does not require answering questions like "what exactly needs to be done?" or "how can this be done?"
    3. Clearly indicate that the meeting goals for the topic were not met. Examples: the discussion was tabled, the admin team did not reach a conclusion, the admin team was not able to make the conclusion actionable.
