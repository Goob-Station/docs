## Overview

Removing NTR role bcs it doesn't makes sense and adds nothing to actual gameplay.

## Background

There is no templates for paperwork implemented on Goob, admins don't have time resolve issues in-game mostly just spawning CC official character if they feel so, so if I understand right intended purpose of this role, it literally has no gameplay to it and irrelevant for an actual gameplay.

People can easily play it not the way admins intend it being played bcs intent is really unclear and each admin defines it as it pleases them and get banned as a result. Better to remove it to avoid such issues. 
 
Still want rather to discuss why is it even in-game before proceeding with PR to remove it.
