Remove NTR role

## Overview

Removing NTR role bcs it doesn't makes sense and ads nothing to actual gameplay.

## Background

There is no templates for paperwork implemented on Goob, admins don't have time resolve issues in-game mostly just spawning CC official character if they feel so, so if I understand right intended purpose of this role, it literally has no gameplay to it and obsolete. Still want rather to discuss why is it even in-game.
