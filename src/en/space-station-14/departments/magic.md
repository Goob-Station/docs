# Thaumotology
THE MAGIC TEAM

## Concept
Thaumotological department is responsible for exploring new dimension called "Shroud" in their soul form to search for magical relics, find scrolls of knowledge and books, and fight the creatures of this dimension. Provide rituals for station benefits with found items.
- **Primary Goal**: Exploring Shroud and keep balance between station benefits and Shroud Power (look "Shroud").
- **Secondary Goal**: Use magical items and rituals to improve other departments experience.

## Player Story
> Ivan Magician starting his round. On start he goes to Shroud Rift to enter Shroud Dimension. He killed some shroud creatures on his way to reduce shroud power, because he don't want to see negative events on station. In the shroud he found two magic scrolls and one unknown relic, so he decided to return back to station from Shroud. He gave relics and scrolls to Artificer, so they can be examined and researched. After his Shroud trip Ivan went to medical with his ritual chulk and some ritual items to make healing circle inside it. 

## Design Pillars
> Department should Lore related
> Department should not be powergaming department
> Department should play around balance between good effect and negative effects
> Department is vulnerable to not magic threats, but powerful against magic threats

### Lore related Pillar:
> New items and mechanics that will be added ingame should have in-game lore written in books that can be found it Shroud. New items and mechanics shouldn't contradict existing lore. It highly undersirable to rewrite an existing lore for adding new item.

### Not powergamy Pillar:
> Mechanics and items should not make thaumotology department to gain more power than other departments. All items that can be found in Shroud should be useful for whole station OR be useful for specific department, but have equal chance to be found with other department-specific item.

### Good-Evil Balance Pillar:
> Items and mechanics should have positive and negative effects. This can be ignored, if positive effect is weak, but it's better to have weak negative effect in counterverse.

### Anti-Magic Pillar:
> Department equipment and mechanics should be weak against non-magic threats and antagonists, so any traitor with viper and esword would see average thaumotologist as weak crew (For example: Antags can consider salvagers, that have similar gameplay as very-armed crew). In counterverse, magic antagonists like wizard or heretic should be afraid of this department crew due to magic resistance or magic supressing items.

## Objectives
> What is this department's objective when it comes to the round? Do they have a unique failure condition? If so, what is it? How does this department's objectives interact with the rest of the station?

## Progression
> How does the *gameplay* of this department change over the course of a round? Are there unlocks? Are players collecting/spending resources? Is this progression tied/related to other departments? If so how?

## Flow
> How does the *experience* of the player change over the course of a round? Are players constantly running around putting out fires or are there breaks in the action? Do players need to wait on other departments as pre-requisites for their own gameplay, or is this department fairly self-sufficent?

## Mechanics
> What major mechanics does this department use and how are they connected to this department.

### Mechanic_Placeholder1 (Not Implemented Yet)
> Each mechanic should have its own subheading and should contain a *short high-level* overview of the mechanic and how it is used by this department. Each mechanic should also link their associated design document as the subheading.

### Mechanic_Placeholder2 (Not Implemented Yet)
> Mechanics that are unimplemented should be marked with (Not Implmented Yet) and should link the associated design proposal if it exists.
