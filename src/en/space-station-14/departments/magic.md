# Thaumotology
THE MAGIC TEAM

## Concept
Thaumotological department is responsible for exploring new dimension called "Shroud" in their soul form to search for magical relics, find scrolls of knowledge and books, and fight the creatures of this dimension. Provide rituals for station benefits with found items.
- **Primary Goal**: Exploring Shroud and keep balance between station benefits and Shroud Power (look "Shroud").
- **Secondary Goal**: Use magical items and rituals to improve other departments experience.

## Player Story
> Ivan Magician starting his round. On start he goes to Shroud Rift to enter Shroud Dimension. He killed some shroud creatures on his way to reduce shroud power, because he don't want to see negative events on station. In the shroud he found two magic scrolls and one unknown relic, so he decided to return back to station from Shroud. He gave relics and scrolls to Artificer, so they can be examined and researched. After his Shroud trip Ivan went to medical with his ritual chulk and some ritual items to make healing circle inside it. 

## Design Pillars
> Department should Lore related
> Department should not be powergaming department
> Department should play around balance between good effect and negative effects
> Department is vulnerable to not magic threats, but powerful against magic threats

### Lore related Pillar:
> New items and mechanics that will be added ingame should have in-game lore written in books that can be found it Shroud. New items and mechanics shouldn't contradict existing lore. It highly undersirable to rewrite an existing lore for adding new item.

### Not powergamy Pillar:
> Mechanics and items should not make thaumotology department to gain more power than other departments. All items that can be found in Shroud should be useful for whole station OR be useful for specific department, but have equal chance to be found with other department-specific item.

### Good-Evil Balance Pillar:
> Items and mechanics should have positive and negative effects. This can be ignored, if positive effect is weak, but it's better to have weak negative effect in counterverse.

### Anti-Magic Pillar:
> Department equipment and mechanics should be weak against non-magic threats and antagonists, so any traitor with viper and esword would see average thaumotologist as weak crew (For example: Antags can consider salvagers, that have similar gameplay as very-armed crew). In counterverse, magic antagonists like wizard or heretic should be afraid of this department crew due to magic resistance or magic supressing items.

## Objectives
> Magic department is semi-support station department. All negative effects related to this department can only happen if this department is present on station and actively do their job. Their main objective - exploring Shroud dimension to find magic artifacts and books.

## Soul interactions
**Splintered Soul** is effect when you separate your soul from your character body. While separated, your main character get special SSD examination text and absolutely vulnerable. Your soul is new entity with your character skin that won't have any item except magic items. Your soul is invisible for other living players, but visible for ghost. Still you can't see ghosts in this form. Your soul in this state have light visible only to you.

In this state you can't make or get any damage to/from living creatures, you can't communicate nor with living creatures (you still can hear them), nor with ghosts (they still can hear you) and can't interact with not-magical items. Note, that your body is still vulnerable and can be killed. If your body taking damage - you'll be warned about it. You can return to your body by colliding with it if your body is not crit or dead. In this state you can't see your health and other related status effects. 

Though you can't get basic damage types in this state you still can be damaged by **Soul flacking**. Soul flacking not considered as damage type and can't be checked or healed. Soul flacking is regenerate overtime and can't be healed by any other means. If your soul will get 100 soul damage you'll be automatically turn to ghost without any mean to return to your old body. You can avoid round removing by keeping **Soul Gem** item in your main body. Upon death your soul will be moved to it and can be returned to your body with special infusion.

There also **Soul attenuation**. It works similar like Soul flacking, but applies on living creatures. If you'll get 100 Soul attenuation your soul will be forcefully separated from your body and your body will get angry NPC behaviour starting to attack everyone. You can't return to your body while you have Soul attenutation effect. Just like flacking, attenuation regenerate overtime.

Read about Shroud Dimension and Abyss Rifts for information about how to get these effects.

## Shroud dimension
Shroud is new dimension that can only be entered in Soul form by **Shadow Rift**. One permanent shadow rift spawns round start in department. Shadow rift from shadow anomaly also can be used to enter the Shroud.

Shroud is mostly dark with few light sources in specific structures and magic mini-light sources as decoration. Dimension is filled with Shroud creatures and obstacles.

Shroud creatures are only damageable creatures in soul state. They also can be damaged by living creatures. These creatures don't any basic damage, but apply **Soul flacking** and **Soul attenuation** on hit. They are main threat of Shroud Dimension. Shroud creatures don't have basic NPC's "attack-dodge" behaviour. They'll constantly follow you even if their melee attack is CD. These creatures immune to all damage, except blunt, holy and magic. 

In addition to enemies Shroud contains some obstacles:
- Shadow Veil - dark opaque fog that always apply soul flacking and soul attenuation to everyone inside it.
- Abyss Chasm - chasm that teleports you to random coordinate in 200 radius near it while applying medium amount of Soul flacking and soul attenuation effect.
- False lammpost - lammpost that mimics Tarnised lamppost (see structures), but changes light color and starts attact you to itself with spawning some weak shroud creatures near it. Can be destroyed by hits. 

Besides enemies there also some new structures in dimension that have special effects, new magical items and artifact or lore information about Shroud.
List of structures:
- Tarnished lamppost - single lamppost with bench near it. You regenerate your Soul flacking faster near it. Shroud creatures can't approach you near it.
- Lone ruin - ruin of buildings that mostly contain common lore information and small amount of shroud creatures. Rarely you can find rare lore information, books or artifacts.
- Eclipsed library - big dungeon with huge amount of shroud creatures, artifacts, books, lore and creatures. Can contain rarest lore items.
- Mirror well - well with dark water. Drinking it will restore hunger and thirst of your main body.
- Light beacon - small beacon will light from it. Big beacon spawns on Shroud entrance when you enter it. Small beacon will allow you to leave shroud in random opened **Shadow** or **Abyss Rift**.

## Abyss rifts
Abyss Rifts are similar to **Shadow Rift** and can be also used to enter Shroud. Abyss Rifts appears on station as random negative effect provided by **Shade** (see **Shade aura and substance**). Abyss Rifts will spawns **Invading Shroud Creatures** in some intervals (their spawn and maximum amount determined by Shade power) and changes tiles to shadow tiles near it. Shadow tiles will have **Shadow Veil** will spawn on them.

Main difference on Invading Shroud Creatures from basic Shroud Creatures - they'll send **Splintered soul** to the Shroud on stacking 100 **Soul attenuation**.

Abyss rifts have same weaknesses as Shroud creatures. While damaged they'll start to consume shadow veil and shadow tiles to heal itself until there is no one left.

## Shade density and substance
**Shade density** is invisible index of Shroud power. Some department action will increase Shade density amount or Shade density increase rate. Upon increasing, Shade density will trigger random negative effect depending on power of Shade. Shade starts slowly decreasing overtime after it stopped increasing. Shade density is unique per grid.

**Shade substance** is special liquid essentia that can be used as a fuel for most magic actions. It can be slowly gathered directly from Shroud by providing **Shadow Needle** in dimension with increasing Shade density gather rate. Alternatively, substance can be slowly produced with special flowers that can be grown by botanists with help of some ritual. Shade substance is liquid that can be stored and moved by special jars. Standard beakers, syringes and reagents will be destroyed by it. Substance also evaporates with tremendous speed on ground with increasing Shade density.

## Magic artifacts and items
**Magic artifacts** are special items that can be found in Shroud dimension. All of them have special ability with random positive and negative traits. For example, there might be neck amulet that passively decreasing incoming pierce damage with decreasing movement speed.

Magic artifacts or items that work like tools or weapon must consume **Shade substance** as fuel for their work.

Magic artifacts can be reforged on **magic anvil** with using of Shade substance. Reforging will reroll their positive and negative effects without changing amount of them. Some infusions and rituals may affect amount of artifacts negative effects or allow to select desired trait.

## Infusion
Infusion is a process of creating new magic items or impoving existing one. To create new item you need to find or made magic books that contain magic recipe. Magic books can be found in Shroud dungeons or synthesized with using of special ritual by consuming huge amount of Shade substance. Magic books with recipe can be used on Infusion Matrix to update it recipe base.

Infusion matrix is multiblock structure with matrix in the middle and 8 pedestals around it. To make new item you should place main item in the middle of matrix and other items, required in recipe, in the pedestals around matrix. Infusion will use huge amount of shadow substance from the jars new matrix. Infusing process will increase Shade density every second as it goes along, depending on **infusion complexity**. Infusion complexity is difficulty of infusion proccess specified by recipe. Complexity also increases negative events amount during infusing process. For example, infusion matrix might spawn Shroud creatures, shoot someone with lighting or create Shadow Veil near matrix.

Infusion can be used for:
- Creaing new magic items with recipes
- Decreasing negative trait or increasing positive trait amount from magical artifact
- Infusing creature to improve them

## Rituals
Rituals are special magic actions that can be provided for fast single effect or prolonged aura effect. Rituals that make single effect will increase Shade density by a certain amount while ritual that creates prolonged aura effect will increase shade density each second it works.

Rituals are multi-tilted chalk pattern. There are three colored chalks (Black, White and Gold). Chalk creates tile-assigned runes. There might be only one rune per tile. Black chalk always used to draw central rune. Yellow and Gold chalks have 4 different rune patterns that can be choosed in radial menu by activating chalk. Some ritual might need different items to start that must be placed on black central rune. To active ritual you need to click on black rune. Rituals effects work on everyone inside rune radius.

Aura rituals can be stopped with destroying of black rune.

Rituals can also be moved on special scrolls to save rituals for future and make it fast when need. To make it you need to click on black rune with scroll when ritual pattern was drawn. When you'll want to use ritual you'll need to use scroll in hand to fast use it or click with scrolls on ground to create step-triggered rune.

Rituals can be used:
- Rituals that make special effect for station (for example: Ritual that can resurrect random ghost and living ghost creature (including antags))
- Aura-creating rituals (for example: Healing ritual that passively heals everyone inside it)
- Creating delayed rune rituals that triggers when someone step on rune

## Soul moving
Soul moving is another way to move minds. Special rituals allow players to move souls in organic bodies. Machines don't have soul and taking machine ghost role will make your soul artificial. It's possible to move soul into NPC creature and vice versa. (NPC moved to player's body will have NPC behavour).
