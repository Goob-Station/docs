## Overview

Add a new midround solo antagonist, Blood Machine (BM)
BM has a ninja-like spawn, they have no equipment, but can navigate in space by their own like space carps.
BM are an IPC, they are taking constant damage, and can be healed masively by splashing blood on themselves.

## Details

Blood Machines spawn close to the station in space, with no equipment and comms, the moment they are spawned they are starting to take constant heat damage,
BMs will die in about 5 minutes if it doesnt heal itself in time. They cant use welding to heal themselves, nor meds, the blood is the only option.

Their only goal - survive, no matter the cost, because the time is ticking. Blood splashing heals an insane amount of heat damage and some brute with rads,
Their fists deal 15 blunt damage and 30 structural, and they have jaws of life in their hands to actually get inside the station. 
They have slots just like a normal IPC, meaning clothing and armor are available.

Simple concept, that can be done purely with yaml (hopefully)


Theoretically, they can act peacefully, powering from monkey blood or critter blood, which is not great, but there is no way of preventing this easily.
