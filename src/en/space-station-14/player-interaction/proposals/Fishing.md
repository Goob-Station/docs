Loosely inspired by fishing as tgstation knows it (as in I had a look at their wiki for some ideas).


## Overview

This would implement a game feature that allows players to use a fishing rod on a variety of different fishing sources and complete a little minigame to dredge up any manner of fish or garbage.  This would be able to continue until the source is exhausted of fish (and miscellaneous garbage).

### Fishing Sources

Different items and tiles in the game would have to function as fishable areas.  Fishing in a water tile on an expedition to another planet would let you reel in fairly ordinary fish, compared to fishing in a plasma tile from a plasma river may dredge up something far more alien and possibly useful for another department.  Fishing in a disposal chute could provide you something stored inside at the current time, or even a rat or another creature that wouldn't be too far fetched to dwell in the disposal system.

These are just two examples, there aren't many limits on possibilities for fishing sources. Being able to fish on water and plasma tiles you would find in the game world seem like a good starting goal to implement.

### Fishing Equipment

As a start, I am prototyping a complete rod functioning as one entity that would be capable of fishing, but my end goal would be different tiers of rods, bait, reels, and lures that make it easier to catch different kinds of fish.

### The Fish!

You would have a variety of fish and items to pull up with your rod, unique to where you pulled them up.  As a good start, I hope to create a number of regular and more "alien" fish for both the water and plasma tiles found in the game world. Some fish would have traits that would make them easier to catch than others, admitting that you are using the correct rod or lure.

### Fishing Minigame
When your line snags a fish (or something else), you would be prompted to complete a short minigame to complete reeling in your catch.  I'm still experimenting with designing a minigame, I want to keep it simple and easy to understand.


## Why?

Fishing is a fun mechanic to use in nearly any sandbox game, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that to my knowledge nobody has been working on implementing it in Goobstation.  It's another fun thing for the crew to get their hands on, whether you're trying to fish up food for the chef, dredge up an anomaly from a river of plasma, or create a bluespace portal to a planet just to relax with some fellow crew members and fish on a light shift.
