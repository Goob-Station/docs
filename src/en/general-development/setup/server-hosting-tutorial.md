# Server Hosting Tutorial

Please simply reference [Wizden's Docs](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/general-development/setup/server-hosting-tutorial.html) on hosting a server and just download the build from [https://cdn.goobstation.com/fork/GoobLRP](https://cdn.goobstation.com/fork/GoobLRP) for LRP or [https://cdn.goobstation.com/fork/GoobMRP](https://cdn.goobstation.com/fork/GoobMRP) for MRP instead of downloading a wizden build.
